# generatingotp
This project is a Python console-based OTP (One-Time Password) Generator that sends the generated OTP to a specified email address using Gmail's SMTP. The project is designed with modular programming in mind, making the code clean, reusable, and easy to understand.

Features
Generates a Secure 4-Digit OTP: A randomly generated 4-digit OTP is created for authentication purposes.

Sends OTP to Any Valid Email: The OTP is sent to the specified email address via Gmail’s SMTP server.

Modular Programming: The code is structured in a modular way using built-in and user-defined functions for clean and maintainable code.

No External Dependencies: The project uses only Python’s built-in modules, ensuring simplicity and easy setup.

Technologies Used
Python 3.x

Modules:

smtplib - for sending emails via SMTP

random - for generating random OTP

email.message - for constructing the email

getpass - for securely handling user input (email credentials)

Setup
To run the OTP Generator project, follow the instructions below:

Prerequisites
A Gmail account to send emails via Gmail SMTP server.

Python 3.x installed on your machine.

Installation
Clone the repository or download the code files to your local machine.

bash
Copy
git clone https://github.com/your-username/otp-generator.git
cd otp-generator
Setup your email credentials:

You will need to provide your Gmail email address and app-specific password to send OTPs.

For better security, consider using App Passwords for Gmail instead of your main password. You can generate an app password from your Google account settings (under "Security" > "App passwords").

Run the script:

Execute the Python script to start generating OTPs and sending them via email.

bash
Copy
python otp_generator.py
Example Output
yaml
Copy
Enter your Gmail Email Address: your-email@gmail.com
Enter your Gmail App Password: ********
Enter the recipient email address: recipient-email@example.com
Generating OTP...
Your OTP is: 1234
Sending OTP to recipient-email@example.com...
OTP sent successfully!
Code Structure
otp_generator.py: The main script that generates the OTP and sends it via email.

utils.py: Contains helper functions for OTP generation and email sending logic (optional file to further modularize the project).

Functions
generate_otp(): Generates a 4-digit random OTP.

send_otp_email(): Sends the OTP to the specified recipient email using Gmail SMTP.

Usage
Generate OTP: The OTP is randomly generated by the generate_otp() function and displayed on the console.

Send OTP via Gmail SMTP: The OTP is then sent to the provided recipient email address using Gmail’s SMTP server, handled by the send_otp_email() function.

Example Workflow:
User inputs their Gmail credentials (email address and app-specific password).

User inputs the recipient's email address.

OTP is generated and sent to the recipient’s email.

User receives an OTP email, which can be used for authentication.

Security Considerations
Email Credentials: Always keep your email credentials secure. Use environment variables or app-specific passwords for added security.

OTP Expiry: This project currently doesn't include OTP expiry functionality, but it can be added as an enhancement.
